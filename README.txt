Node version: v16.17.0
Express version: v4.18.2
Nodemon version: v2.0.22

Instructions:
  To run this application, you have to "npm install" or "npm i", then you run node server.js or npm start
  If you want to run this using the nodemon module, run "npm i" then "npm install -g nodemon" and then
  nodemon server.js.
  
  Nodemon is time-efficient for code testing because it makes it so i don't have to restart the application
  when i make changes, only need to reload the browser 

Try accessing the applications using any of this:
  http://localhost:3000/mytunes.html
  http://localhost:3000/mytunes
  http://localhost:3000/index.html
  http://localhost:3000/
  http://localhost:3000

Issue(s):
  There should be no issues fortunately.
